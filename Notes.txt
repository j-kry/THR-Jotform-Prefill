1. Loop while no director
2. Change function to take 1 param idNum    
    use url 1 if numId.length <= 5
    else use url 2
3. Check if title contains assistant || senior
    then check if director
    else
    move up the chain
4. Check with quality on what to do if the first person matched is a director - who to notify?


DESIGN NOTES
1. Only main page and 1 sub page
2. On submission of employee id stay on the same page and hide the form and show the retrieved info
    Person can verify that info is correct and can then continue on to jotform
3. Display the submitter's name, their supervisor's name, and their director's name



IMPROVEMENTS
1. Validate input on same page
2. switch over to react
3. assistant vs program or does it not matter
